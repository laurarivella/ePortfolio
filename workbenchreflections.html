										<h2>Artifact</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
The artifact of my final project consisted of a Decision Support System coded to help General Practitioners (GPs) of medicine in Italy deal with the security of their patients data when communicating via email.
									<br>
I knew I wanted to research ways to improve the cybersecurity of GPs since I am familiar with their struggles to keep up with both technology and legislation.
<br>
GPs in Italy are overwhelmed by the amount of patients they are assigned and usually unable to keep up with the security demands of telemedicine.
<br>
Finding ways to automate the most administrative and repetitive partes of their workflow and take some of the security burden off would greatly improve both their security posture and legal compliance, in turn giving them more peace of mind to focus on the patients. 
<br>										
I would like to keep pursuing this stream of research and turn it into a professional endeavor. 
<br>	
Having a strong desire to provide support and help otehrs with their security issues I would welcome the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on others in that respect. 
In my current work position, priviledged though it may be, I sorely lack a meaningful connection to the service I provide to clients.

										<h2>Final Project</h2>
									</header>
									<p>								
The final project as a whole has been a fascinating process for me given the requirement of the artifact since in my previous postgraduate disseration experience there had been no requirement beyond the dissertation itself. 
<br> 
The artifact has been an equally thrilling and challenging pursuit since every step from the actual artifact to produce to the finished model has been akin to navigating in uncharted waters being forced to solve one issue at the time.
<br>
It has been that element of the constant unknown that has made the most impact on me in terms of growth. 
										<br>
It translates very well to other project, especially professional ones in which the end result may be in focus but how to reach it remains a hazy mist to be navigated by sight one waypoint after the other.
										<br>
Artifact related challenges aside it has been a smooth process thanks in part to my experience with dissertations. Time has been managed correctly and this time I successfully anticipated and tood steps to mitigate the impact of the slump that occurs at the end of the writing phase when one is almost finished but cannot bear to re-read the whole dissertation again.
