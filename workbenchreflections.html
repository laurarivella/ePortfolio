										<h2>Unit 3 - Research Proposal Review</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The exercise was to consider my thoughts on the chosen area od interest for the research project.
									<br>
									Undertaking this exercise in unit 3 may be too soon to have a complete answers to questions. 
My project could probably be a mix or exploratory and descriptive research.
I am thinking of looking into cybersecurity applied to GP doctors in Italy. 
<br>
The nature of the research would lend itself to qualitative methods of research, however, the biggest issue would be the time available to carry it out such as the feasibility of condutiong interviews. This is a good reason why quantitative methods along the lines of survey research would probably not fit the time frame granted for the dissertation project. 
<br>
There are options to contact the Italian Association of General Practitioners and I could have access to GPs leveraging my personal network.

										<h2>Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										
This reflective activity was focused on the case of Cambridge Analytica and the 2018 scandal in which the fact that they obtained and shared the data of millions of Facebook users was uncovered and made public. The data was obtained through surveys on Facebook and it could be the highest profile case of using surveys for alternative means or profit. 
<br>
The exercise was to see if there have been similar cases, which has proven difficult to carry out in terms of finding examples of inappropriate use of surveys similar to Cambridge Analytica. The main hypothesis to explain this is that companies pursuing similar activities are caucious in the way they publicise their services. 
<br>
The events around Cambridge Analytica happened because of an opportunity to gather the data and a very lax attitude on the part of Facebook to protect the privacy of its users. Cambridge Analytica collected people's data without their permission and such data was used to profile potential voters and tailor political discourse in the hope of swaying elections. 
<br>
There is a company called IDEIA (Idea in Portuguese), which has been displaying a similar modus oprandi to Cambridge Analytica. 
It claims to work with international political parties, mostly in Portuguese and Spanish speaking countries, promoting psychological profiling tactics.
<br>
In the cases section of their website, which changes content based on the selected language among the available ones, I noticed a nation-wide survey on the intention to vote in Brasil "before the start of the political campaign". (IDEIA, 2018) This was the only survey I could find that stayed on topic for the current discussion. They state that 26 thousand interactions on Facebook have been analysed. Unfortunately, no further details on the way it was conducted are given. 
<br>
Digging a bit more into their website, I found that IDEIA offers to collect and monitor data from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, in addition to leveraging bots for What's App and related technologies. (IDEIA, 2019) While these companies provide APIs to give limited access to anonymized and aggregated data, all three social media companies have terms designed to restrict mass data collection. Facebook has a total ban on scraping, which refers to a third party collecting data from a website or app without direct access to its database without express written approval. (Facebook, N.D.) Major social media companies prohibit third parties from scraping publicly available data.
<br>
This example allows us to highlight few issues, the most relevant to me based on my background being social and legal ones. 
<br>
The first social and ethical concern I would raise is about IDEIA’s methods in general, and specifially the use of targeting, which is showing political content to particular groups. Targeting raises civil liberty concerns since it involves threats to the integrity of our elections by weaponising personal data to to manipulate how and whether we vote at all. 
One of the most important watchdog institutions monitoring this is the Center for Digital Democracy, which though its reports really conveys the extent and the pervasiveness of these issues. (CDD, 2022)
<br>
Other concerns are legal ones. IDEIA's stance is that they collect "open" data on Facebook such as public posts and likes, maintaining that they do not target individuals specifically. According to GDPR, users need to know that this data may be used and analysed by third parties. Usually, companies carrying out profiling activities justify their services by stating that they collect anonymous data. It is however truly difficult to collect anonymous data and according to GDPR data is only anonymous if it’s impossible to identify someone based on that aggregate data, even when cross-analyzed with other data. 
<br>
This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the damage that companies like Cambridge Analytica or similar ones have done and still capable of doing. As a political scientist specialised in security studies and venturing into cybersecurity, it is incredibly important to keep researching this topic and maintain vigilance.

										<h2>Unit 6 - Wiki Activity</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										
			Among the cybersecurity questionnaires to be found by institutions, the Bank of England's financial sector continuity cyber resilience questionnaire is the one that struck me the most.
<br>
										<br>
With this being a cyberesilience questionnaire for financial institutions aimed at evauating resilience of the whole financial sector of the UK to ensure its continuity, there are a few suggestions for improvement that can be put forward.  
<br>
										<br>
										<b>Design and format</b>
										<br>
										<br>
While it is understandable that it would be written in an Excel spreadsheet in order to facilitate building a risk model around it and identify mitigations, it does still make it more difficult to handle than a pdf with dropdown menus for instance. 
<br>
Overall the design is a quite crowded and the sections are not separated as well as they could be, perhaps color coding could help the reader navigate it better. Another way to mitigate the issues and make the design neater would be to have different sheets for the different topics and sections, this would also help model the answers if that is the intended pourpose. 
<br>
Displaying answers to chose from in the way that they are layed out contributes to the crowded feel of the questionnaire and if one were to read them as intended from A to D they are quite wordy and require a lot of focus which makes the exercise less optimal and more prone to errors. 
<br>
The addition of a Glossary section is quite welcome and should be a standard feature of technical questionnaires. 
<br>
										<br>
										<b>Content</b>
										<br>
										<br>
In terms of content, the first elements to stick out are the length of both questions and potential answers. Upon a closer inspection it would appear that instead of the traditional set of replies (e.g. "Yes", "No", "N/A", or "Don't know") the designers opted for scenario selection. An educated guess would lead to the belief that assigning a letter from A to D to a scenario would inform further analysis at a later stage. 
<br>
The content of the questions itself does support the choice of answers and is straight to the point, however some questions such as number 25 could have been split in two to cover the two topics separately. This is an example out of many questions which do try to fit multiple concepts into one single question. This inevitably leads to a crowded answer in that the various scenarios do have to cover more possibilities. 
<br>
Simplifying the questions and having only one key concept or topic per question would improve readability, improve the preciseness of the answers and allow for more accurate further analysis. If one were to model the answers by assigning values and weights to the answers, it would indeed be better if only one topic or concept were to be assigned to one value. 
<br>
At the moment of writing there are no other entries from peers to comment on.

										<h2>Unit 8 - Summary measures statistical worksheet</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
		<u>Exercise 8.1</u>
										<br>
										<br>
Calculated n, mean and SD
<br>
										<br>
What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?
Diet A has on average resulted in more weight loss than diet B. 
<br>
										<br>
<u>Exercise 8.2</u>
										<br>
										<br>
Calculated sample median, sample quartiles and sample interquartile range 
<br>
										<br>
What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?
The sample interquartile range of the weight loss for Diet B is -3.451 therefore a high proportion of individuals on that diet had a negative weight loss so the diet hasn't been effective. 
<br>
										<br>
	<u>Exercise 8.3</u>
										<br>
										<br>
Calculated frequencies and percentages for the cosumption of brands of cereal in Area 2.
<br>
										<br>
What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand preferences for each of the two demographic areas?
Area 2 appears to enjoy cereals from brand A and brand B more than Area 1.

										<h2>Unit 8 - Hypothesis testing statistical worksheet</h2>

				<u>Exercise 8.4</u>
										<br>
										<br>
Assuming the data to be suitably distributed, completed a two-tailed test of whether the population mean impurity differs between the two filtration agents
<br>
										<br>
Interpret your findings.
The sample mean numbers of impurity between the two filtration agents were respectively 8.3 for Agent 1 and 8.7 for Agent 2.
The data therefore suggests that Agent 2 has higher impurity. 
<br>
										<br>
<u>Exercise 8.5</u> 
										<br>
										<br>
In Exercise 8.4, a two-tailed test was undertaken of whether the population mean impurity differs between the two filtration agents.
Suppose instead a one-tailed test had been conducted to determine whether Filter Agent 1 was the more effective. 
What would your conclusions have been?
<ul>										
<li>The associated one-tailed p-value is p = 0.0087, so the observed t is significant at the 1% level (one-tailed).</li>
<li>The data therefore constitute strong evidence (on a one-tailed test) that the Agent 1 has less impurities than Agent 2 and should be preferred.</li>
									</ul>										
<br>
										<br>
	<u>Exercise 8.6</u>
										<br>
										<br>
Assuming the data to be suitably distributed, complete an appropriate test of whether the population mean income for males exceeds that of females and interpret your findings. 
Sample mean for income for M and F is 51 and 46 respectively so mean income for males exceeds that of females.
