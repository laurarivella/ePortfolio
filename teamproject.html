										<h2>Team Meeting notes</h2>
									</header>
									<p>We meet weekly on Thursdays.</p>
									
										</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 1 </u></p>
											</div>
									                <p>During the first team meeting we managed to draft, review and sign the team contract. Since we have already been working together as a team, both processes have been quite smooth and everyone knew what to expect. We kept this meeting very relaxed and informal due to the fact that we all recognize that a 12 unit course will be much different to a 6 units one and therefore we need to pace our effort accordingly so as to avoid burning out halfway through. </p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 2</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>In the second team meeting we discussed the ePortfolio and AWS Educate website setup in addition to how to go about scanning the other team’s website. We talked extensively about the first assignment and how best to approach it. We focused on how to approach the Design Document as opposed to trying to propose content already because we knew that what we discussed in it would have major consequences on how we would approach the final assignment, since it was a Executive Summary based on the Design Document.</p>
						
											</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 3</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>During team meeting 3 we did a recap of the seminar held the previous day.
												I suggested to keep an ePortfolio checklist on Google Drive so that every team member can reference that and update it as the module progresses. It appears a lot of my peers are having difficulties with the ePortfolio so I am trying to make it as easy as possible for them. 
												As a team we all leaned on Shiraj and his vast knowledge and experience in pen testing for team activity 3 and scanning the other team’s website. He was very patient in addressing any questions we had and guiding us through the steps while leaving room for mistakes that we could rectify live while we were on the call. 
												We also divided the workload and the areas of research that each team member had to look into for the Design Document.</p>
		
											</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 4</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>Team meeting 4 was focused on the Design Document and we discussed our individual research. 
											As always, we made sure that we played on each member’s strengths while trying to learn as much as possible on every topic. This encouraged learning and making mistakes in a “safe environment”. 
											We also had a look together at what peer responses we may write for the discussion forum.</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 5</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>In team meeting 5 while we did identify peer responses and determined what to write on the forum, our priority for the meeting was the Design Document.
											We went through what everyone had written for the Design Document and determined that everything looked on track both in terms of content and word count, with only a few minor adjustments to be made by the next meeting.</p>

											</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 6</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>By the end of team meeting 6 we had assembled the final version of the Design Documents, merging all of our research into one cohesive document. We also managed to draft the parts we had decided to write all together and while this was a bit of a gamble it paid off quite nicely. The drafting process was very smooth and it encouraged discussion of ideas. 
											This is indeed a benefit of having a tried and tested team, we could not have done this had this been our first module as a team. 
											With a content approved draft, I took care of refining the style and formatting references and bibliography, which I then submitted to the team for review via Slack before we submitted it.</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 7</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>In team meeting 7 we wrote down the questions for Doug during his open office session. They concerned the GDPR case study and a clarification on the security standards to apply in the Executive Summary.  
												We discussed all of the team assignments and exercises due in the following couple of weeks, the ePortfolio activity on Kali Linux, the wiki entry and the discussion forum. This way, once most of these are out of the way, we can focus one hundred percent on the final assignment, which does require its time. 
												Instead of dividing the workload for the Executive Summary, we decided to have a look at the assignment checklist individually and reconvene in the next meeting.</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 8</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>In meeting 8 we assigned of which parts to research and write on of the Executive Summary. This was already plenty of work since we also needed to evaluate the feedback we got from the Design Document and decide on how to go about the Executive Summary. </p>
						
											</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 9</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>Meeting 9 was focused on refining the parts we wrote. We all looked at each other’s contributions and tried to apply some constructive criticism as it is customary. </p>

											</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 10</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>During meeting 10 we further improved on the Executive Summary and we tried to save some time to go through the Team Debate Activity. </p>
											
											</div>
											<p><u>Recap of team meeting 11</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>I wasn’t there due to a family engagement which saw me travel to another region of Italy. 
												Upon my return it became apparent that the group had difficulties during the meeting and that some parts of the assignment were being reworked. I quickly tried to make the document flow to the best of my abilities, format it and hand it over for submission.</p>

												<h3>Unit 6 vs. Unit 11 assignments</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Since in our team we are all accustomed to working together, there has been less of a difference in both process and quality of work between the two assignments. Our productivity system has been tried and tested and it still very similar to the first version we applied during our first module together back in January. While we do keep the same productivity system for every assignment, we do adapt it to what type of assignment needs to be turned in. 
												We have also been through the exact same dynamic with the Risk Management module in which we had to submit a Design Document and then an Executive Summary. The only difference there was that there was no pen testing required.  
												If we focus on the two assignments due in this module, I must say we were slightly taken aback by having to work the pen testing into the documents, mostly due to word count and combining the technical side with the framework and methodology. However, we managed to overcome this challenge and further improve in the final assignment.
