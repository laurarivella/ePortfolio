										<h2>Literature Review</h2>
									</header>
									<p> 
							The literature review was carried out on cybersecurity applications in detecting political misinformation on social media platforms.
										<br>
										<br>
the outline was as follows:
										The literature review will aim to analyse the use of cybersecurity tools and techniques in detecting political misinformation on a social media platforms.
Zooming in on one social media platform will become feasible once the preliminary searches will be carried out. 
The Introduction will address the need for the review, its significance and clarify the structure of the paper. It will also address the context, prior research, research goals. 
The Research methodology section will introduce the framework used to synthesise the literature, the selection criteria of the studies (together with the sources and keywords used), inclusion and exclusion criteria.
In the Findings section there will be the main findings in the literature on the topic, an overview of the strengths and limitations of the selected literature.
Finally, the Discussion will deal with any discrepancies in the literature and conclusions drawn from the analysis of the literature. 
<br>
										<br>
										In the final version I expanded on Twitter as a social medial and it ended up being quite an interesting topic to investigate. 
										<br>
The main conclusion drawn is that for the research question examined, cybersecurity tools and efforts have been almost exclusively related or tied to AI and machine learning models to detect bots. 
Moving forward, greater attention should be paid to how cybersecurity ties into all aspects of misinformation on social media. Starting from the fundamental properties of cybersecurity, threat modelling can take place and an analysis of what can be done in terms of security can take place. 
At the same time, the pursue of hybrid approaches should be encouraged in that more subject matter experts with a mixed background of social sciences and cybersecurity should research topics such as the research question we examined. In doing so, the range of approaches to the issue would expand and contribute to making progress.

										<h2>Research Proposal</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										
									The research proposal concerns the development of an applicable cybersecurity ontology for general practitioners of medicine.
										<br>
										<br>
 
In Italy there appears to be very little literature on cybersecurity or data security applied to the healthcare sector. GPs represent the first line of our national healthcare system and are very vulnerable to privacy and data security issues since they do not receive adequate training and operate in their own practices with IT material that is independently sourced. 
<br>
An ontology can pull information from multiple sources, put it in an understandable language to reach the most amount of users possible and guide them in the application of security measures. 
It can also be changed or updated in the future, thereby being a very adaptable tool.   
<br>
Part of the problem of cybersecurity is that it must be understood by users in order to improve the chances it will be applied correctly. Security can be broken down into a problem that encompasses both policy and mechanism of application. The aim of the project is to focus on the creation of the policy side of cybersecurity. 
<br>
Literature wise, one could start from semantic web primers such as the one from Antoniu & van Harmelen, 2008. Ontologies per se have been written, such as the one by the MITRE corporation for the cyber security domain (Obrst et al., 2012) or one for information security by researchers in Sweden (Herzog et al., 2007). However, these efforts are general and not targeted to the healthcare sector. 
<br>
The development strategy would be to use the online software Protégé by Stanford University to create my own cybersecurity ontology. (Stanford University, 2020) 
 <br>
The effectiveness of the ontology and its applicability to real world issues of data security will be supported by a programme that will act as proof of concept. 
 <br>
By creating a programme that understands the ontology, one possible application to the case at hand could be an email checker. If the programme detects sensitive information or anything that would go against predetermined policies, legal requirements or technical ones, it would not send the email and throw an error that would inform the user on what is happening and how to solve the issue. 
<br>
A further step could be the implementation of machine learning algorithms and therefore the system could be trained to always improve detection.  
<br>
The programming language used will be R due to my familiarity with the language and its strong machine learning capabilities. 
 <br>
In terms of proposed activities, so far the major blocks would be:
<ul>
  <li>Literature review</li>
  <li>Evaluation of existing security ontologies</li>
  <li>Evaluation of existing security ontologies</li>
  <li>Choice of machine learning algorithm</li>
  <li>Definition of security policies</li>
  <li>Skeleton of the programme in R </li>
  <li>Testing the effectiveness of the checker</li>
  <li>Gathering quality machine learning material to train the system on </li>
  <li>Implementing machine learning algorithm and begin of system training</li>
  <li>Checking effectiveness</li>						
</ul>

<br>
So far, no ethical considerations have been raised due to the fact that the project would not require human participation.

										<strong>Data collection method</strong>
										<br>
										    <br>
										As far as the data collection method goes, for this project the data collected would be information to populate or expand the ontology and inform the susequent policies. 
										 <br>
										Additionally, data sets for training the system to classify documents would need to be either retrieved or made up. 
										<br>
