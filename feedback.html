										<h2>Feedback from my peers</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										The main feedback I got from my peers throughout the module has been regarding my role as team lead and the way I have tried to keep the team organised. 
										It's worth mentioning that I have been working with two of my team mates for the module for the past six months and we already had a good working relationship before beginning the NISM module. 
										What they have frequently mentioned is the fact that they find a lot of value in my meeting recap emails, in the meeting agendas I send the day prior to our meetings, and in general my way of taking the lead and presenting team assignments suring the seminar or writing the discussion forum posts on behalf of the team. 
										I believe that what all of these things have in common is the way I can deal with a lot of different information and perhaps different views, and condense it into a coherent argument. 
										To be honest, I could not consider or call myself an intelligence analyst by trade were I not able to organize and present information or keep things tidy and organised.
										Humor appears to have helped team cohesion as well and, coupled with some diplomacy, has greatly helped us get through these three months without any tension building up between us. 
				                                                I do realise that humor is not welcomed in every context and there's a place and time for it, that is why I made sure at the beginning of every module to ask if it was bothersome or if it helped. 
										During this Master's and during all the modules I have been team lead it has been appreciated as a coping mechanism to deal with stress.

												<h3>Feedback from the tutor</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											The feedback I got from my tutor can be divided into three categories:
											<ul>
											  <li>Assignments related feedback </li>
											  <li>Discussion forum posts</li>
											  <li>Feedback during seminars or presentations</li>
											</ul>
											It is worth mentioning that the line between my individual contribution, therefore feedback aimed only at myself, and team work is quite blurred in this module. 
											The feedback we got for the assignments highlighted a good knowledge and understanding of the topic. We could have discussed more on assumptions and limitations, however, certain areas had to be underdeveloped due to word count. 
											The lack of criticality showed a bit in some parts of the assignments. Personally, I am trained to question everything in a relentless way, it is in my DNA as a Security Studies Specialist from the Aberystwyth school of thought and in my everyday work. 
											It is likely that we had to compromise in some parts of the assignments due to word count constraints. 
											In general, our work appeared to be always well presented and has sparked good quality debate.

										<h2>Improvement board</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Based on the feedback received, I would like to research and work on: 
									<ul>
									  <li>Ways to keep teams organised - maybe experimenting more with Slack and Kanban boards.</li>
									  <li>Different personalities and ways people react to constraints and stress. Perhaps though books and case studies.</li>
									  <li>Project management. I am currently dealing with this at work as well and I am quite sure there is a whole lot more to learn about it.</li>
