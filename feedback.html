										<h2>Seminar 2 - Peer review activity</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
	We were asked to analayse two papers utilising two dirrerent types of research methods to achieve their aims.
										<br>
	I chose to delve into "videogmes in eLearning" as I was looking for a different topic and wanted to see if there was literature on it. 
	Given that this MSc is fully eLearning based I also wanted to know if there are similarities from a sociologial/human interaction perspective in the literature on the topic. 
        I think it's also easy to forget that videogames are part of the computing field and the variety within the industry is vast. 
										<br>
	I chose the following articles:
	<ul>
		<li>Hieftje et al. (2018) But do they like it? Participant satisfaction and gameplay experience of a public health videogame intervention in adolescents. 
		2018 IEEE 6th International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health (SeGAH). DOI:Â 10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401349. Available from:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8401349</li>
		<br>
		<li>Martin, V. S. (2008) Online Videogames in an Online History Class.Proceedings of the Second IEEE International Conference on Digital Game. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/DIGITEL.2008.46.Available from:https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/DIGITEL.2008.46</li>

									<br>
									<strong>Purpose and research question of each paper:</strong> The purpose was to enrich a learning experience in addition to teaching or encouraging further research.
									<br>
									<br>
<strong>Were the papers in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic?</strong> I went into this exercise with very low expectations since I am aware of the way the topic may be perceived. 
									Videogames aimed at eLearning have tended to be quite unsuccessful in the past so I have found these articles to be steps in the right direction. 
									It's not about actually teaching something in the traditional way, it's more about leveraging them for certain dynamics such as immersion that other methods are not as good at. 
									<br>
									<br>
<strong>Contribution to the collective body of knowledge?</strong> As mentioned the collective body of knowledge on the topic is not that solid, so I would say that both papers are great contributions in that they represent successful applications and case studies for future work. 
									<br>
									<br>
									<u>Martin, 2008 - History/strategy videogame paper</u>
									<br>
									<br>
									In terms of stated pourpose
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Is the research methodology appropriate?</strong>
									Yes, papers, tests, discussion boards and interviews were used. The author looked for common themes in the material as well. 
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Was data collection and analysis appropriate?  </strong>
									Yes because the author did not limit himself to interviews or evaluating papers only but tried to have a wider range of data to analyse as well. 
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Does the paper support its claims with explicit evidence?</strong>
									<br>
									<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Specific Question</th>
    <th>Evidence</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1) Does the paper engage students in history in a way not possible with books or lectures, but complementing these materials? </td>
    <td>Students better understood the idea of macro history, and were able to empathize more with the way historical agents may have felt (e.g. the fear of the American colonists or the racial superiority of the colonizers of Africa).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2) Does the page create an atmosphere of group learning in an online class?</td>
    <td>Yes, among the students who participated there was a great sense of community and shared interactive. The students in the videogame project were frequently in contact with each other via email or the discussion board.</td>
  </tr>

<br>
<strong>How would you enhance the work/paper?</strong>	
I would conduct more studies like this one to see if they have applications in other areas of knowledge as well.
