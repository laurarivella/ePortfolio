										<h2>Seminar 2 - Peer review activity</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
	We were asked to analyse two papers utilising two different types of research methods to achieve their aims.
										<br>
	I chose to delve into "videogames in eLearning" as I was looking for a different topic and wanted to see if there was literature on it. 
	Given that this MSc is fully eLearning based I also wanted to know if there are similarities from a sociological/human interaction perspective in the literature on the topic. 
        I think it's also easy to forget that videogames are part of the computing field and the variety within the industry is vast. 
										<br>
	I chose the following articles:
	<ul>
		<li>Hieftje et al. (2018) But do they like it? Participant satisfaction and gameplay experience of a public health videogame intervention in adolescents. 
		2018 IEEE 6th International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health (SeGAH). DOI: 10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401349. Available from: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8401349</li>
		<br>
		<li>Martin, V. S. (2008) Online Videogames in an Online History Class. Proceedings of the Second IEEE International Conference on Digital Game. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/DIGITEL.2008.46.Available from:https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/DIGITEL.2008.46</li>

									<strong>Purpose and research question of each paper:</strong> The purpose was to enrich a learning experience in addition to teaching or encouraging further research.
									<br>
									<br>
<strong>Were the papers in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic?</strong> I went into this exercise with very low expectations since I am aware of the way the topic may be perceived. 
									Videogames aimed at eLearning have tended to be quite unsuccessful in the past so I have found these articles to be steps in the right direction. 
									It's not about actually teaching something in the traditional way, it's more about leveraging them for certain dynamics such as immersion that other methods are not as good at. 
									<br>
									<br>
<strong>Contribution to the collective body of knowledge?</strong> As mentioned the collective body of knowledge on the topic is not that solid, so I would say that both papers are great contributions in that they represent successful applications and case studies for future work. 
									<br>
									<br>
									<u>Martin, 2008 - History/strategy videogame paper</u>
									<br>
									<br>
									In terms of stated purpose:
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Is the research methodology appropriate?</strong>
									Yes, papers, tests, discussion boards and interviews were used. The author looked for common themes in the material as well. 
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Was data collection and analysis appropriate?  </strong>
									Yes because the author did not limit himself to interviews or evaluating papers only but tried to have a wider range of data to analyse as well. 
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Does the paper support its claims with explicit evidence?</strong>
									<br>
									<table>

    <th>Specific Question</th>
    <th>Evidence</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1) Does the paper engage students in history in a way not possible with books or lectures, but complementing these materials? </td>
    <td>Students better understood the idea of macro history, and were able to empathize more with the way historical agents may have felt (e.g. the fear of the American colonists or the racial superiority of the colonizers of Africa).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2) Does the page create an atmosphere of group learning in an online class?</td>
    <td>Yes, among the students who participated there was a great sense of community and shared interactive. The students in the videogame project were frequently in contact with each other via email or the discussion board.</td>

<br>
<strong>How would you enhance the work/paper?</strong>	
I would conduct more studies like this one to see if they have applications in other areas of knowledge as well. 
									<br>
									<br>
									
									<u>Hieftje et al., 2018 - Intervention paper</u>
									<br>
									<br>
									In terms of stated purpose:
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Is the research methodology appropriate?</strong>
									Yes, the authors used both quantitative and qualitative methods. 
A quantitative player experience assessment was used to collect quantitative data using an assessment tool developed specifically.  Participant satisfaction and gameplay experience were assessed using 12 Likert-type questions (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, Strongly
Agree, Not Sure).
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Was data collection and analysis appropriate?  </strong>
									Qualitative in-person interviews were used appropriately as a way to capture more indepth data on participants’ satisfaction and gameplay experience. The qualitative, structured interview guide was developed in an iterative process with input from an interdisciplinary research team and it was adequately collected.

    <td>1) Does the paper ensure that there is awareness and sensibility towards topics such as dangerous sexual behaviours, drug abuse, alcohol consumption? </td>
    <td>They got a lot of material and interaction out of teenagers, which is per se an achievement. The majority of student had a positive experience, empathised with characters in the game and reported having used in game dialogue options in real life to get out of peer pressure situations. They were able to deal with those situations thanks to having had a previous simulated experience and having had time to reflect on it.</td>

										<h2>Seminar 3 - Case Study: Privacy</h2>

									</header>
									<p>
										We were required to examine a case and consider the ethical issues involved.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The Case</strong>
Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. 
<br>
<br>
For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.
<br>
<br>
Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. 
Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.
<br>
<br>

<u>If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</u>
<br>
No, he should not. The researcher should refer to the responsible person/authority for the potential release of the data. 
<br>
<br>

Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files.
<br> 
<u>What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</u>
<br> 
According to leading institutions such as the BCS and ACM, Ricardo should be aware of several ethical issues in granting access to Beth.
<br>
<br> 
The first issue would be to try to avoid harm by disclosing information without a just cause as stated in principle 1.2 of the ACM. (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018) To minimize the possibility of indirectly or unintentionally harming others, computing professionals should follow generally accepted best practices, in which case Ricardo should refer to applicable law on the subject. 
<br>
<br>
Other issues would be to respect privacy by only using personal information for legitimate ends and without violating the rights of individuals and group as stated in principle 1.6 of the ACM. (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018) The right of the individuals here being rooted in GDPR. Furthermore, there is the issue of honouring confidentiality (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018)  and having due regard for privacy. (BCS, 2021)
<br>
<br>
<u>Other questions were:</u>
<br>
	
<ul>
<li>Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? </li>
<li>Should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher?</li>
<li>What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</li>
</ul>
No, they should not. The biggest issue is that the individuals owning the data are not aware and did not consent to changes to the conditions of handling of their data. Laws such as GDPR state the right to be informed (art. 13 and art. 15), which is a key transparency requirement since individuals have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their data. (European Parliament and Council, 2016)
<br>
<br>


<u>Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</u>
<br>
She has to accept that she does not have enough data to carry out her research. She can look into expanding the data set by integrating it or research another set of data alltogether. If she structures her research with a clear data policy that does not change midway thorugh, she may be able to get a complete set of data from the start.

										<h2>Seminar 4 - Inferential Statistics Workshop</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
In Seminar 4 the only preparatory activity we were asked to do was to look at the inferential statistics worksheet in unit 8. I did so as required and got to the seminar with an 
										understanding of what I would need to do. 
										During the seminar the statistical activities were only briefly discussed with the majority of the hour at our disposal being used to 
										reiterate the assignments and deadlines. 
										This was a pretty informative seminar albeit lacking in statistical discussion. 
									</p>
									
										<header class="major">
										<h2>Seminar 5 - Workshop on Presenting Results</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
									Seminar 5 provided a very detailed overview of everything that is expected of us and of all the formative activities and assignments. 
<br>
<br>
As customary for me, I will keep adding bits and pieces of what is discussed in the seminars to my to do list and to my ePortfolio list so as not to miss anything and turn every assignment in early. 
<br>
At the beginning of every module I tend to go through the whole module unit by unit and start making lists of what needs to be accomplished every unit. This way, I am always sure I am working on time, if not ahead of schedule, and I can pace the module in a way that accommodates my schedule while never being behind schedule. 
<br>
<br>
During Seminar 5 we were given excellent pieces of advice for the proposal and the power point presentation of it. 
<br>
Keeping the focus narrow and the discussion focused on the topic without any digressions is what resonated the most for me.
<br>
During my MA in Security Studies at Aberystwyth University, my dissertation advisor decided to leverage my willingness to approach and analyse a topic from many different angles. However, I need to bear in mind that for this project, an alternative and more focused approach is required. 
<br>
Ultimately, while it is a Masters dissertation project, it is an entirely different kind of project with respect to the one I have completed before.

									<p>
										Karen has been very supportive and has provided quite a bit of feedback throughout the entire module.
										<br>
								<br>	
									  <b>Literature Review Outline</b>
										<br>
										I was given positive feedback on how I structured the document and on its logical flow. That reassured me in terms of having a strong foundation on which to build the review itself.</li>
									  <br>
								<br>
								<b>Literature Review</b>
								 <br>
							I was given generally positive feedback on the assignment with some degree of variability among the single criteria. 
								<br>
								While well written and with clear application of knowledge, the Review lacked deeper research. I identified gaps in the literature, which can be seen as a positive, however, it reflected negatively in this exercise because I struggled to identify enough research to underpin the subject. 
								<br>
								I realized while I was carrying out the exercise that there was a lack of information and research in the specific area I have chosen and I stated it in the Review as well. Moving forward I should select a subject with more sources of information and research that I can tap into fully. 
								<br>
								A broader research base would allow me to cite more, which has been another issue in my Review. 
								<br>
								A key point in the feedback has been that in higher word count assignments such as a dissertation, limitations in research undertaken would really show the lack of critical research.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Research Proposal Outline</b>
								<br>
								Overall, the Proposal Outline appeared to be laid out to a professional standard and would therefore be considered a good base on which to build the Research Proposal itself.
								<br>
								I do need to be mindful of maintaining my research focused and ensure that the strand of research I chose to pursue has enough research and publications available to fully develop my investigation.
								<br> 
								I did unintentionally use an acronym without expanding upon what the initials meant, therefore I must may attention in the Proposal so as not to make the same mistake again. 
							<br>	
								<br>
									  <b>Research Proposal</b>
								<br>
								
								
									
								<br>	
										<br>
								<b>Umbrella feedback</b>
								<br>
								The general feedback we have received concerned citing regularly, using references correctly, objectivity and academic tone and maintaining paragraphs even in length.
								<br>
								<br>
								Additionally we were reminded of good academic practice and standards emphasising the academic default font, double line spacing the content and avoiding listing or bullet points. 
								
								
								<br>
								<br>
								<u>Based on the feedback received, I would like to focus and work on</u>:
									<ul>
									  <li>My ability to find, organise and build an in-depth accessible amount of research prior to delving into an assignment.</li>
									  <li>Devoting more time to the planning and early development phases of research in order to work on the points I was given feedback on.</li>
