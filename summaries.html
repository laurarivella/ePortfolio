										<h2>Team exercises</h2>
									</header>
									<p>During this module I was lucky enough to work with the same team I have been working with since January plus the addition of Chris.
									We worked really well together and I shall make sure to go into details in the sections below.</p>
								</div>
							
								<p><u>Unit 3 - Scanning exercise</u></p>
											</div>
									                <p></p>
									
								<p><u>Unit 7 - Scanning exercise and Collaborative Learning wiki</u></p>
											</div>
									                <p></p>
						
								<p><u>Unit 7 - ePortfolio Team Activity on kali Linux</u></p>
											</div>
									                <p>For this team activity we had to read a few reviews of available PenTesting tools and evaluate them.
											One article by Leroux (2020) concerned Kali Linux and the other by Bhatt (2018) was a study paper on Kali as well. 

											We had to answer the following questions:
											<ul>
											  <li> What does the article teach you about carrying out vulnerability scans using Kali?</li>
											  <li> What issues might you encounter?</li>
											  <li> How would you overcome them?</li>
											  <li> How do their results compare with your initial evaluation? </li>

											  <li> What do you think of their criteria?</li>
											  <li> What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs. Nessus?</li>
											  <li> Has this changed your original evaluation score?</li>
											</ul>

											My team’s answers and thoughts are presented below. Shiraj, having a lot of experience, has definitely guided us through some of the answers. However, we purposely answered them separately before reviewing the answers together so that we all had a chance to do research on our own without relying too much on Shiraj. 

											The articles were great in that they taught me the correct sequence to perform the actions in and detailed the various phases of a pen test using Kali. It was extremely useful to see Kali applied to a real-world situation 

											The results in the papers are quite similar to our use of the tool and our results. The only difference is that we included other tools in our scan as well such as Nikto.  

											The criteria used in the articles are excellent qualitative-wise in that they cover most if not all the quality a good pen test software should have. However, they do only provide whether a tool has a feature or not by using a yes/no system. 

											Kali is still open source while Nessus is now a proprietary tool.
											Our original evaluation score has not changed.

								<p><u>Unit 8 - GDPR Case Study</u></p>
											</div>
									                <p></p>
	
								<p><u>Unit 10 - Data Breach Case Study</u></p>
											</div>
									                <p>For the Data Breach case study we went with the PlayStation Network hack since we all more or less qualify as gamers within the team and have done plenty a team building activity through gaming together. 

											On the surface it looks like any other data breach case study in which users’ personal data were stolen, however it does have more interesting elements. We’ll never know the full story since Sony essentially shut down any information on this, including whether the ICO was notified, whether or not they had a business continuity plan and how much data was actually stolen. 

											Educated guesses led us to believe that they did notify the ICO, since they got fined for their lack of security, and that a good deal of personal data was stolen, including perhaps credit card details. It’s worth noting that Sony gave 10-20 euros back to players to spend in the PSN Store, I was among the many who got this money and it made me glad I’ve always used a pre-paid card for my online purchases, even when I was in my teens. 

											The PSN hack is a great case study for a few reasons:
											<ul>
											  <li>It happened right at the beginning of online services and digital purchases becoming relevant</li>
											  <li>The attackers used a DDoS attack to create a diversion and then proceeded to compromise the machine of a SysAdmin while everyone was focused on the DDoS attack</li>
											  <li>It has hacktivist implications since it was done also as a reprisal to protest Sony’s legal actions against George Hotz, a programmer who managed to reverse enginneer the PlayStation 3</li>
											</ul>
											</p>

								<p><u>Unit 11 - Team Debate</u></p>
											</div>
									                <p>As a final team activity we had to read two articles on alternative networking architectures and make supporting arguments for a position assigned to us. 
											We were Team 1 and our “belief” was that the future of the Internet is based on content centric networking (CCN &/or NDN or COAST).
											We had to prepare a few slides on this and present them during the last seminar. 

											I had a lot of fun preparing this activity in that we had a very pleasant discussion with the team and I then volunteered to prepare the Power Point presentation.
											Since I do have a basic understanding of the topic assigned to us but I know I cannot compete with the technical knowledge of some of my peers, I ran this as a political campaign which is within my expertise. 

											Below are sample slides

												<h3>Discussion forums</h3>
											</header>
											
											<h3>Collaborative discussion 1</h3>
											
											<p>In collaborative discussion 1 we had to read Glisson et al. (2015) “Compromising a Medical Mannequin”. We had to perform an analysis of the threats discussed in the paper and propose mitigations. This has been a great start of the course since it encouraged the systematic analysis of security breaches and potential issues from the very beginning. It really set the tone for the rest of the module. It gave me a chance to build on the knowledge acquired in previous modules and keep pushing the boundaries of cybersecurity knowledge.</p>
						
											</div>
											<p><u>Intro Post</u></p>
											</div>
									                <p>In the Intro Post I tried to recap the major vulnerabilities such as DoS and brute force attacks. I made use of the OWASP website to look for valid mitigations. 
												Additionally, Cybok Security body of knowledge has been quite useful.</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Peer Responses</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>In the peer responses I focused on the issue of usability when it comes to multi factor authentication, which I purposefully omitted in my intro post. I suggested that the use of MFA could be improved by providing background knowledge and risk trade-offs of non-adoption before deploying it, in addition to security training for employees and users.</p>
						
											</div>
											<p><u>Summary Post</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>The contributions from my peers highlighted extremely valid points. They gave me the chance to explore further measures such as IP address lockout, lockdown mechanisms, 
											The fact that we were dealing with a Medical Device made it fun to go and have a look at what is currently applicable in terms of cybersecurity regulations for medical device. I managed to look into the Medical Device Coordination Group (established by Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745), the FDA and the International Medical Device Regulators. Cybersecurity regulations for medical device emphasise security by design and testing of the device in its context of use, thereby trying to maximise usability while still maintaining security standards. </p>

											<h3>Collaborative discussion 2</h3>
											
											<p>In collaborative discussion 2 we scanned the other team’s website and we familiarised ourselves with several of the tools needed to perform the assignments. </p>
										
											</div>
											<p><u>Intro Post</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>We discussed the results of the scan, which started with a ping command. This is helpful for quickly testing various points on a network. We then moved to finding all the possible information about the domain thanks to the Whois tool basing our search on the IP address. We got various details like registrant and registrant org, where it was registered as in the country, who the registrar is, the officiating organisatio, registration date and when it was last updated. To extract information about the domain we used nslookup, we gathered information like DNS servers, where we interacted with it and got it to tell us all the records for a given domain. Unfortunately, there was no MX record as no mail server is set up. We did however discover the Name Servers, SOA Authoritative server for this domain and DNS record for the webserver and IP address.</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Peer Responses</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>We made good use of the peer responses to discuss some technical details with other teams, which has been a fantastic opportunity to see how other students went about their scanning.
												Among the several points, one of the most salient was the challenging nature of applying OSINT procedure to inspect vulnerabilities in the general IT environment since the system boundary and communication patterns are ambiguous. It is possible to efficiently apply OSINT procedure to a critical infrastructure network because of its character of communication patterns and environments.
												</p>

											<p><u>Summary Post</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>In the summary post we addressed some comments and points regarding the Whois tool.</p>

											<h3>Collaborative discussion 3</h3>
											
											<p>In collaborative discussion 3 we kickstarted things with selecting a GDPR case study. 
												Among the many ones which were proposed by the university, our choice was made based on how interesting a case was and how much it related to the current module. 

												We selected a 2017 case of Failure by the Department of Justice and Equality to impose the correct access restrictions on access to medical data of an employee.

												</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Intro Post</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>In the intro post we were asked to assess which aspects of GDPR had been breached, what the outcome of the case was and what steps we would take if this had been our organization. 

											This is a relevant case to our field of study since it has to do with the disclosure of sensitive personal data through a failure to apply proper permissions in a database. The complainant found out that his line manager put a file with sensitive personal data about him on a database which about 80 employees that did not have permission to see that data could access. The specific GDPR aspect addressed is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal data to third parties. 

											It was interesting to note that the Department did offer an amicable resolution consisting of an apology and removal of the document from the database but the complainant refused it, escalating the case to a formal decision by the Commissioner.

											We stressed the fact that had regular audits and reviews of the databases to address the presence of confidential information been carried out, the document would have been found and removed sooner. We also emphasized the need for an adequate system of training for staff managers should be implemented to educate them on data protection.
											</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Peer Responses</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>Peer responses highlighted arguments to support the case such as a more in depth look at unauthorized disclosure and special category data. </p>
						
											</div>
											<p><u>Summary Post</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>From most of the posts by our peers, reflecting most cases, it would appear that there is still a severe lack of training and sensibility when it comes to applying data security. It was indeed discussed in seminar 4 as well, where we brought up real life scenarios from our experiences on the job.
											We believe there are two further aspects worth bringing up once more: a lack of attention on the part of the human, and a lack of intelligent implementation of automation. The latter being particularly evident in all the cases about the right to erasure that our peers examined. We have examined and made further contributions on Charlotte's case in particular. By lack of attention we mean a laissez-faire approach to data security, motivated either by a lack of resources available, or by a negligent attitude and lack of enforcement. This point was also discussed thoroughly in Seminar 4 as data insecurity is still a pervasive issue.
