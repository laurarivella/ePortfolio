											Grace replied to my intro post with quite gripping questions concerning fairness and ethics.
											
												Perhaps due to my background as a political scientist, I would not necessarily see the issue through the lens of fairness but in terms of applicable legislation since the two do not always go hand in hand. 

If this case concerned the UK for instance, the employees would be protected by law for whistleblowing on the issue, so the codes of ethics we examined and the applicable legislation would be aligned. In the UK, whistleblowing law is located in the Employment Rights Act of 1996 (UK Government, 1996) which protects registered workers even in the presence of a confidentiality clause in their contracts. 

To count as whistleblowing, and therefore to be granted protection even in the presence of a confidentiality clasue, the complaint has to concern a criminal offence and someone's health and safety being in danger among other issues. (Gov.uk, N.D.)

Codes of ethics have to be reflected in the legislation in order to be applied in a concrete way. In the EU a Directive on whistleblowing entered into force at the end of 2019 and member states had until the end of 2021 to transpose it into their national legal and institutional systems. (European Commission, 2018) So far, the track record is not perfect as there has been no transpositionl yet, only 8 out of 27 states adopted the legislation, 18 delayed the process and 1 has not started yet. (EU Whistleblowing Monitor, 2022) 

The issue of larger companies or corporations you highlighted would deserve at least a whole paper to attempt to analyse it as I think it is quite intricate and an answer would need to consider political climate, strength of involved governments, applicable international law (if present and acknowledged by the involved governments), economic climate. 

								
											Issues still left on the table are:	
											<ul>
											  <li> Going deeper into whistleblowing legislation around the world to see if efforts are present anywhere other than the UK and the EU. </li>
											  <li> The issue of using AI to potentially harm or kill people. Is there discussion that is leading to integrating this into legilation anywhere in the world? </li>
											  <li> How larger companies or corporations may get away with breaking the law or displaying unethical behavior with or without the consent of involved governments. </li>
											</ul>
