											</div>
									                <p>For this first scanning exercise we relied on Shiraj quite a bit since none of us had any previous experience on this topic other than him. We were asked to perform a scan using standard tools such as ping, traceroute, dig and nslookup. Making use of these tools we had to answer some questions on how many hops from machine to machine, what was the average delay, what were the nameservers, if the MX record for the website was and where the website was hosted. 
											In addition to discussing the results of the scan we had to answer the following questions in seminar 2:
											<ul>
											  <li> Did you have any issues or challenges with the scans?</li>
											  <li> How did you overcome them?</li>
											  <li> How will they affect your final report?</li>
											</ul>

											We did not have issues or challenges with the scans since we were already accustomed to working together and we understood how to lean on Shiraj while learning from him as opposed to just having him do the job and us not learning anything. We all overcame our lack of expertise by watching Shiraj performing the scans and trying ourselves in turn asking questions. Our final report was not affected by it.

									                <p>For this exercise we had to scan against our assigned website using Kali Linux and answer some questions regarding open ports, the OS, protection, known vulnerabilities and so on. 
											All and all this has been a solid exercise to carry out as a team, albeit a bit more time consuming than what we would have liked considering the rest of the coursework to do.
