												<h3>Discussion forums</h3>
											</header>
											
											<h3>Collaborative discussion 1</h3>
											
											<p>In collaborative discussion 1 we had to read Glisson et al. (2015) “Compromising a Medical Mannequin”. We had to perform an analysis of the threats discussed in the paper and propose mitigations. This has been a great start of the course since it encouraged the systematic analysis of security breaches and potential issues from the very beginning. It really set the tone for the rest of the module. It gave me a chance to build on the knowledge acquired in previous modules and keep pushing the boundaries of cybersecurity knowledge.</p>
						
											</div>
											<p><u>Intro Post</u></p>
											</div>
									                <p>In the Intro Post I tried to recap the major vulnerabilities such as DoS and brute force attacks. I made use of the OWASP website to look for valid mitigations. 
												Additionally, Cybok Security body of knowledge has been quite useful.</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Peer Responses</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>In the peer responses I focused on the issue of usability when it comes to multi factor authentication, which I purposefully omitted in my intro post. I suggested that the use of MFA could be improved by providing background knowledge and risk trade-offs of non-adoption before deploying it, in addition to security training for employees and users.</p>
						
											</div>
											<p><u>Summary Post</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>The contributions from my peers highlighted extremely valid points. They gave me the chance to explore further measures such as IP address lockout, lockdown mechanisms, 
											The fact that we were dealing with a Medical Device made it fun to go and have a look at what is currently applicable in terms of cybersecurity regulations for medical device. I managed to look into the Medical Device Coordination Group (established by Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745), the FDA and the International Medical Device Regulators. Cybersecurity regulations for medical device emphasise security by design and testing of the device in its context of use, thereby trying to maximise usability while still maintaining security standards. </p>

											<h3>Collaborative discussion 2</h3>
											
											<p>In collaborative discussion 2 we scanned the other team’s website and we familiarised ourselves with several of the tools needed to perform the assignments. </p>
										
											</div>
											<p><u>Intro Post</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>We discussed the results of the scan, which started with a ping command. This is helpful for quickly testing various points on a network. We then moved to finding all the possible information about the domain thanks to the Whois tool basing our search on the IP address. We got various details like registrant and registrant org, where it was registered as in the country, who the registrar is, the officiating organisatio, registration date and when it was last updated. To extract information about the domain we used nslookup, we gathered information like DNS servers, where we interacted with it and got it to tell us all the records for a given domain. Unfortunately, there was no MX record as no mail server is set up. We did however discover the Name Servers, SOA Authoritative server for this domain and DNS record for the webserver and IP address.</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Peer Responses</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>We made good use of the peer responses to discuss some technical details with other teams, which has been a fantastic opportunity to see how other students went about their scanning.
												Among the several points, one of the most salient was the challenging nature of applying OSINT procedure to inspect vulnerabilities in the general IT environment since the system boundary and communication patterns are ambiguous. It is possible to efficiently apply OSINT procedure to a critical infrastructure network because of its character of communication patterns and environments.
												</p>

											</div>
											<p><u>Summary Post</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>In the summary post we addressed some comments and points regarding the Whois tool.</p>

											<h3>Collaborative discussion 3</h3>
											
											<p>In collaborative discussion 3 we kickstarted things with selecting a GDPR case study. 
												Among the many ones which were proposed by the university, our choice was made based on how interesting a case was and how much it related to the current module. 

												We selected a 2017 case of Failure by the Department of Justice and Equality to impose the correct access restrictions on access to medical data of an employee.

												</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Intro Post</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>In the intro post we were asked to assess which aspects of GDPR had been breached, what the outcome of the case was and what steps we would take if this had been our organization. 

											This is a relevant case to our field of study since it has to do with the disclosure of sensitive personal data through a failure to apply proper permissions in a database. The complainant found out that his line manager put a file with sensitive personal data about him on a database which about 80 employees that did not have permission to see that data could access. The specific GDPR aspect addressed is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal data to third parties. 

											It was interesting to note that the Department did offer an amicable resolution consisting of an apology and removal of the document from the database but the complainant refused it, escalating the case to a formal decision by the Commissioner.

											We stressed the fact that had regular audits and reviews of the databases to address the presence of confidential information been carried out, the document would have been found and removed sooner. We also emphasized the need for an adequate system of training for staff managers should be implemented to educate them on data protection.
											</p>
									
											</div>
											<p><u>Peer Responses</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>Peer responses highlighted arguments to support the case such as a more in depth look at unauthorized disclosure and special category data. </p>
						
											</div>
											<p><u>Summary Post</u></p>
											</div>
											<p>From most of the posts by our peers, reflecting most cases, it would appear that there is still a severe lack of training and sensibility when it comes to applying data security. It was indeed discussed in seminar 4 as well, where we brought up real life scenarios from our experiences on the job.
											We believe there are two further aspects worth bringing up once more: a lack of attention on the part of the human, and a lack of intelligent implementation of automation. The latter being particularly evident in all the cases about the right to erasure that our peers examined. We have examined and made further contributions on Charlotte's case in particular. By lack of attention we mean a laissez-faire approach to data security, motivated either by a lack of resources available, or by a negligent attitude and lack of enforcement. This point was also discussed thoroughly in Seminar 4 as data insecurity is still a pervasive issue.
