										<h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
																				Grace replied to my intro post with quite gripping questions concerning fairness and ethics.
											<br>
												<br>
												Perhaps due to my background as a political scientist, I would not necessarily see the issue through the lens of fairness but in terms of applicable legislation since the two do not always go hand in hand. 
<br>
	
												<br>
The issue of larger companies or corporations you highlighted would deserve at least a whole paper to attempt to analyse it as I think it is quite intricate and an answer would need to consider political climate, strength of involved governments, applicable international law (if present and acknowledged by the involved governments), economic climate. 
<br>
												<br>
								
											Issues still left on the table are:	
											<ul>
											  <li> Going deeper into whistleblowing legislation around the world to see if efforts are present anywhere other than the UK and the EU. </li>
											  <li> The issue of using AI to potentially harm or kill people. Is there discussion that is leading to integrating this into legislation anywhere in the world? </li>
											  <li> How larger companies or corporations may get away with breaking the law or displaying unethical behaviour with or without the consent of involved governments. </li>
											</ul>

										<h2>Action Plan</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
The discussion was about a case study on accuracy of information in which a researcher and statistical programmer named Abi receives a project from a manufacturer 
to review the nutritional value of a new cereal. Abi collects the data he needs but soon discovers that what he collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is
nutritious and may also indicate that the cereal is harmful. 
<br>
										
										<br>
										
Personally, I was pushed to think about the issue in a different light by Shiraj who began his argument by going all the way back to research ethics. By offering a definition of research ethics, focusing then on the proper way to conduct scientific research, he really made me think of the roots of the issue with Abi's case and not only of the consequences, which had been my primary focus when I wrote my intro post. 
<br>
										<br>
The contribution that Grace on the other hand, pushed me to consider different potential scenarios I could encounter in my work as a cybersecurity practitioner. With the way she tackled Abi's case she made me try to contextualise it in more IT and cybersecurity predominant scenarios while maintaining a focus on the ethics.
