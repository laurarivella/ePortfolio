										<h2>“Many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded <br> 
											to their disciplinary traditions and fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders.” <br> 
											(Stahl et al., 2016)</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
The article gives quite a few points to reflect on since professionals working in the tech field should always keep in mind that technology affects virtually all other aspects of life from economics to the environment. (Stahl et al., 2016)

<br>	
										
If we consider my role as a computing professional, and specifically as a cybersecurity consultant with a background in intelligence analysis, the ethical issues mentioned in the paper that affect me the most in my work are privacy, autonomy and trust. 

<br>
										
These issues affect my role in the company in that they are the basis of whatever type of project requires my attention. 
Conscious of the fact that there is no right way to conceptualise these three issues, I chose to put autonomy as the foundation for this reflection. 
Autonomy can be defined as the ability to construct one's own values, make one's own decisions and act on these decisions. (Brey, 2005)
 
<br>
										
To me, this ties deeply into professionalism and the ethical principle to serve the public good. 
Coming from a background of political science, and specialising in international politics and security studies, I can all to well imagine times when the interests of an employer or clients may try to take precedence over the public good. Arguably, computing professionals, and professionals at large, have a duty to serve the public interest (Mitcham, 2009) and to uphold the ethical standards being discussed and agreed upon by reputable computing and technology trade associations such as the AMC, BCS and IEEE. 

<br>
										
Contextualising professionalism and trying to imagine steps and actions that could be taken during an actual project I would say:
<ul>
  <li>Really understand what is being asked of me or of the team. I would include both written agreements such as contracts and, most importantly, spoken agreements. The former can include vague definitions which need to be questioned and clarified; the latter can be insidious since they can be leveraged by power plays but are hard to prove. </li>
  <li>Whenever something does not feel right, question it. Perhaps bringing attention to what you have identified as potentially unethical or suspicious, ask for second opinions on it, evaluate how others see the situation or react to it. This can inform the next steps to be taken which may include getting in touch with the ethics committee of the company, if present, and voice your concerns.  </li>
</ul>
 
<br>																		
								
Privacy follows autonomy since both are tied to the issue of having control over your own data. (Stahl et al., 2016) Privacy can be divided in two main forms: data privacy and personal privacy. (Stahl et al., 2016) Data privacy concerns data about oneself and personal privacy includes forms of privacy not explicitly addressing data about oneself, such as the distinctions between “public” and “private”. (Nissenbaum, 2004)
 
<br>							
									
As a cybersecurity professional I deal with both forms of privacy, and I tend to see the issue through the lens of security. Security is key in protecting privacy norms since technical measures (e.g. security architectures) help ensure that threats such as unauthorized access of personal data are avoided. (Al Ameen et al., 2012) When it comes to data privacy as well, it can be protected by using policies that aim at maintaining confidentiality through the restriction of the ability to process personal data. (Mizani & Baykal, 2007) Additionally, another key aspect to keep in mind as computing professionals is the fact that anytime data is collected, the user must be aware of it and notified accordingly. (Wasieleski & Gal-Or, 2008) 
 
<br>								
									
Steps and actions that can be practically taken when it comes to privacy could be: 
•	Truly questioning and paying attention to the way the work one is conducting affects or could affect privacy issues. This would include the analysis of scenarios and pre-emptive measures (e.g. how can this work be used incorrectly at a later stage).
•	Keep in mind that data and privacy are linked to clients and people. Maintaining a human tie to it could avoid becoming jaded after performing the same work activities day in and day out. 
 
<br>									
									
Security and privacy lead us to the issue of trust. Trust is a multifaceted concept that can be connected to privacy and security in that it concerns the processing of data. Trust is also an evaluation of the perceived credibility, motivation, transparency, and responsibility of a system, its designers, and operators. (Stahl et al., 2016) There is therefore a relationship between all these elements that rests on the confidence that the system and the processing of data happens in an correct way. 
 
<br>									
									
Being a human actor in the process, steps and actions that can be taken to ensure ethical standards could be:
•	Establish a culture within the team that is focused on planning and tolerant of mishaps. If a member of the team does not feel safe in alerting of a potential trust issue or mistake that could lead to loss of trust, the process and the end product will not be optimal. 
•	Ensure that everyone shares the project goals and understands trust in the same way. 
•	Do not trust in order to establish trust. When designing systems or solutions, not trusting and questioning products and components will greatly help in creating trust. This is meant neither in a negative way, nor a paranoid one, it is simply an exercise in asking questions and maintaining focus. 

<br>									
									
The actions and steps proposed in the analysis of autonomy, privacy and trust could lead to legal, social and professional issues.
Professionally, there might not be room to implement even a single one of the actions proposed if one works for a company which is not inclined to accept them. In case of an ethical conflict which cannot be solved, resigning and distancing oneself from the situation would be ideal, even if harder to do. 
In terms of legal issues, one must be careful not to breach contractual agreements or undertake illegal actions, either explicitly or implicitly (e.g. by omission). 
From a social point of view maintaining a sound and vigilant approach would ensure both applicability of the steps and actions proposed and their positive impact on society at large through well designed tech systems and products.
