										<h2>My study path in the NISM module</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
								This module has been quite a rich one in terms of topics covered. This variety worked really well for me since it gave me the chance both to venture outside of my comfort zone and to remain in it applying my knowledge to new scenarios. I’m referring respectively to the technical scanning/pen testing aspects, and to the law-oriented parts such as the data breach case or the GDPR applications and case studies. 

								The impact with the technical pen testing has been a lot to come to terms with at first. However, I think this is one of the best aspects of Masters level education, it is necessary to hit the ground running and perform well from the very first week of a new module. I immersed myself fully into the reading, trying to understand all I could about an alien subject in the span of days, and thanks to my team mates and our joint effort, we managed to familiarise ourselves with the topic and build on it week after week. 

								This ties into the learning process as well, as a team and as individuals we are trying to put the knowledge we acquired in previous weeks and modules to use. 
								The way I like to think about postgraduate level education is like an atom, there is a nucleus consisting of your previous experiences, both academic and work related. Around this nucleus revolves everything you are learning which distributes itself in levels and just like electrons. Given enough energy, what you learn moves from level to level, back and forth, to be applied to the case at hand. 
								In this Masters I am going through the same processes I went through during my first one since the structure and the way to go about things is essentially identical both being UK degrees. What is changing in this one, other than the subject, is the presence of a great deal of teamwork and team assignments. 

								In terms of learning process per se, I am really happy with it since I have a great team. We have all offered our expertise to mentor others on the subjects we are comfortable with and we all made sure to learn from each other. This aspect combined with the autonomous reading and learning has made for a great module in terms of experience gained and acquired knowledge. 
								This is another thing I love about postgraduate education, it’s not only about the critical aspect or the fact that we are encouraged to question and challenge assumptions. It’s the fact that we all come with different experiences and previous knowledge, most of the times from vastly different backgrounds as well. Without this variety there could never be growth. It’s one of the main reasons why I decided to go for a second Masters degree instead of just getting cybersecurity certifications, which for mere employment reasons would have been equally acceptable. 

								Concerning my contribution to the assignments and the teamwork, I made sure to play to my strengths whenever I could to help the team. Admittedly, the workload is quite high, and it should be so at this level of studies. Making sure that everyone helps out and plays to their strengths is therefore essential to be consistent and produce quality work week after week. A lot can happen in three months, some of us raised puppy dogs and some even got married during this time, so we had to be smart about managing the assignments. I have been lucky enough to be team lead since we started working together in January and that has given me the opportunity to keep everything organised, which I thoroughly enjoy, mostly because it reduces the stress on individual team members. I made sure that communication was always open and honest through a combination of humor and diplomacy. Whenever I could, I volunteered to present case studies and showcase our work since not everyone in the team enjoys that. My background as political scientist came in handy several times, most notably on law matters but also in the team debate, which I turned into a political campaign since I knew I could not win stressing only the technical side. 

								I am very pleased with the work we have managed to produce as a team. The question to ask next is if we could have done a better job with the two main assignments. The answer is both yes and no. With the time we had and our constraints, no, we did the absolute best we could, and I stand by that. 
								Yes, there is always a different way to tackle an assignment, so theoretically we could have done a job that resonated more with the ideal that the person who thought of the assignment had of it.  

								Had I the option of retaking the module I don’t believe I would do anything in a significantly different way. I don’t believe that pushing any harder during team meetings would have resulted in an improved productivity or teamwork, actually, I enjoy our team dynamic the way it is, relaxed but on point. To alter it would likely spike productivity in the short term but create an unsustainable pace and amount of stress, which would lead to a disaster around the halfway point of the module. 
								I have noticed I tend to underestimate my work and my contribution to the team. To a certain degree it’s normal, however I would like to work on being a bit more objective about my work. I also want to improve in project management mostly from a technical perspective, since I think I have the human side of it down.
