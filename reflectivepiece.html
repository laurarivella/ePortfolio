										<h3>On my studies</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
Pursuing a Masters Degree while working full time has been a demanding endeavor which has admittedly brought me to my current limit. It has required unwavering dedication and an all in mentality to remain consistent throughout two and a half years.									
<br>
										<br>
As it has been during my previous academic experience as well, what one is left with, both in terms of knowledge and experience, is well worth the effort.
			<br>
										<br>
In a field like cybersecurity, where "experts" and "specialists" abund due to the market's demand, having a solid and well rounded foundation on which to build further will be invaluable in the years to come as I continue to pursue more knowledge.
<br>	
										<br>
I have been pushed while being ancouraged not to dismiss what I have learned during previous academic and professional experiences. This has led me to successfully complete the module while pursuing my own path.
										<br>
										
										
										<header class="major">
										<h3>On my achievements</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
One of the key achievements has been managing to switch work sector thanks in part to the fact that I was pursuing this degree. Upon graduating from my first Masters in Security Studies I struggled to find a job that would benefit from my sklls set and pivoting to cybersecurity offered me a great opportunity to make use of it.
<br>
										<br>
Thanks to my previous academic endeavors and experiences, I would consider a figure such as myself a bridge between the technical side of cybersecurity and its human, political and contextual side. 
<br>
										<br>
Being able to understand both worlds has value in that it can lead to more productive cooperation and therefore more security. 
										<br>		
										
										<header class="major">
										<h3>On the feedback I received</h3>
									</header>
										<br>
It has been an absolute pleasure to participate in each and every module of the course and I have been very fortunate in that all my tutors have done a remarkable job, more often than not going above and beyond the call of duty. 
<br>		
										<br>	
 The feedback process at the University of Essex has been taken extremely seriously and I have given and received feedback from my tutors regularly throughout the modules, both formally and informally.
									<br>		
										<br>
The feedback I received both from my tutors and my peers throughout the modules and the group projects has been positive and it has encouraged me to keep smoothing out any rough edges I had and still have. 
<br>									
<br>	
One can only self-assess so far without feedback from the outside. Both the feedback and the reflective activities have sparked a great deal of introspection and work on refining my technical, academic and social skills.
